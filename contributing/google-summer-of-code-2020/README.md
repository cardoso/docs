## Project Ideas

### Improve Documentation Framework (Versioning)

### Omnichannel: Support for Voice and Video Calls

- **Mentors**: @gazzo, @tazzo

With these two new features, Omnichannel users will be able to initiate video and audio calls between them and Omnichannel agents.

Google Home/Assistant devices support, if possible, should also be considered concurrently. The focus will be on devoting more time to improve the features which add more advantage and serve a frictionless experience when used via voice compared to features which have a limited use and are better performed using a GUI.

A blind user should be able to easily add servers, change servers, read messages and send messages, as well as other additional functions such as editing profile and creating channels. The proposal should contain a per-screen study of the current App's state of accessibility (what is missing and what needs to be improved), and a roadmap to take it to a delightful state.

After that, the app should validate if the user has learned the meaning of the word, sending the definition and some word options, or some sentence with the word and a gap to fill. Also the app would show the user's performance. There are some API's to get the words and the meanings. e.g ([WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/), [Datamuse](https://www.datamuse.com/api/), [Oxford](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/), etc) (needs to be evaluated deeply)
